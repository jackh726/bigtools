Bigtools is a library and associated tools for reading and writing bigwig and bigbed files.

The primary goals of the project are to be
- Performant
- Extensible
- Modern

### Performant

Bigtools uses `async/await` internally to allow for efficient, multi-core computation when possible. In addition, tools are optimized for minimal memory usage. See [Benchmarks] for more details.

### Extensible

Bigtools is designed to be as modular as possible. This, in addition to the safety and reliability of Rust, allows both flexibility and correctness as a library. In addition, its extremely easy to quickly create new tools or binaries.. (TODO: mention python wrapper)

### Modern

Bigtools is written in Rust and published to `crates.io`, so binaries can be installed with `cargo install bigtools` or it can be used as a library by simply including it in your `cargo.toml`.

## Library

### Example

```rust,norun
use bigtools::bbiread::BigWigRead;

let mut reader = BigWigRead::open("test.bigWig").unwrap();
let chr1 = reader.get_interval("chr1", 0, 10000).unwrap();
for interval in chr1 {
    println!("{:?}", interval);
}
```

## Binaries

TODO

## Benchmarks
[Benchmarks]: #Benchmarks

Benchmarks are included in the `./bench` directory. The require `python` to run.

Multiple tools are compared against the comparable UCSC tools. For completeness, both single-threaded and multi-threaded (when available) benchmarks are included.

TODO: include image of benchmarks
